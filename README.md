# MARTSIA-Algorand-CSC

**Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications**

We implemented the smart contract for this MARTSIA version in PyTeal, making it AVM-compatible. 
This version requires multiple Atrribute Certifiers to confirm the operations on smart contracts.
